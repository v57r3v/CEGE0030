CEGE0030 – Roads and Underground Infrastructure 
TUNNELS COURSE WORK 
- This coursework will   be done   in groups   of   3   persons.
- As part of the coursework, you need to define a group leader to communicate with the   coursework coordinator
- As a group you must organise   meetings to discuss the coursework progression and create minutes that will   be   used to demonstrate   how you divided the work and   how   you   have   informed your peers. A simple and effective model   of the   minutes   is available for   download   on   moodle   and these must be attached to the end of your submitted coursework. 
- These documents are the only   way to calculate a   scale factor to   derive the   individual   mark,   from   the final coursework mark. Small differences in workload are expected but you should balance the proportion of work amongst group members.
Introduction and scope of the project 
Your   team is required   to design the northern branch of   the Crossrail 2 (CR2) line, going from Alexandra Palace to Seven Sisters (Figure   1);   however,   rather than having a stop   at Turnpike   Lane station, your stop   must   be at Wood Green station.   New Southgate will   be a terminal station and the exact   location of   the portal has not been defined yet. Your design should consider that the springline of   your tunnel is located at a depth of 20m below Alexandre Palace station, at an alignment similar to the railway alignment   aboveground; this is your starting point. The running tunnels, at Seven Sisters, must be pointing south, towards Dalston Kingsland, aligned with the A10      near Seven Sisters station.   The client also wants Seven Sisters station on the CR2   line, to   have access to   both      South   Tottenham   station   on   theovergroundlineandSevenSistersStationontheVictorialineand Rail Network.   Therefore, you must decide where the   platform. tunnels will   be   located, to   give   the   best   possible   access      to the lines mentioned above.
During the design, the following aspects (not limited to)   must be considered:
-A geotechnical soil profile along the   route must   be created, together with the likely   problems that may   be encountered during   the excavation of   the   tunnels.
- Horizontal and   Vertical alignments of   the   tunnel, as well as   the geology excavated must be   supplied.
- The   line will   be composed by twin tunnels wi代 写CEGE0030 – Roads and Underground Infrastructure

- A definition of the type of TBM   machine that   shall   be   used,   as well   as   an   estimation   of the pressures required by the ground, in order to allow excavation to proceed safely must be calculated and shown in   the report.
-Shafts   for   ventilation and emergency access   to   the   tunnels must be designed along   the line.   Your   team must decide what is the   best   location for the shafts, as   well   ashow   it will   influence the   alignment.   A   small paragraph with an explanation   must   be provided. 

Figure   1 – Part of the Crossrail2   project to   be designed inside the red circle.-Platform. tunnels   must   be   located   as   near   as   possible to the   existing   stations. At   this   stage   stations   will   not   be   redesigned   but   connection   to   the   existing   stations   and   location   of   the   escalator   tunnels   must   be   specified on the drawings of your proposed station and connections.
-A calculation of   the stresses likely   to be encountered on   the tunnel lining and caused by   the soil load,   together with a surcharge of 65kPa, must   be   calculated.
-A settlement through must be created considering a face loss of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0%, over the whole area   of   the tunnel.
-An analysis of the structures that are likely to suffer from differential settlements, between Wood   Green and Seven Sisters stations must be performed. This must include listed   buildings.
Deliverable 
You are   required to write a   report, with no more than 2000   words   in the   main   text   (excluding   captions,   references, summary and index), explaining briefly   your considerations and assumptions. Most of the information should be conveyed with drawings and sketches and there is no limit for these.   Please make sure that your drawings or sketches have scales and areworded to convey the right information. Sketches without a number or a name will be ignored and not considered on the marks. 
At the end of   your coursework, a set of meeting dates and minutes, describing what was agreed and spoken   during the   meetings   may   be submitted as an appendix – there   is   no   limit of   words. This   part   will   only   be   used in case there are disputes   related how much each team   member   has contributed to the final report.
