Brief: The    objective    of   this    project    is    to    design    a    new    road      in    the    area      of    Sheffield,      alignmening    with   infrastructure   development   priorities   in the   Midlands   and   Northern   England. The   road   connects two   villages   and   comprises   two   lanes   (one   per   direction),   with   a   total   daily   average   traffic   flow   of   9,500   vehicles   (70/30%   split). The traffic   study   indicates that   35% of vehicles   are   heavy,   with   each   tupically   having three axles. The   road’s design   life   is set at   40   years.
The   chosen   cross-section   is   on   a   straight   reach   of   the   road   (no   curvature   in   the   plan   view),   and   the   alignment   raises the   road elevation   by   1.2   m above the   natural ground   level.
Materials and Geotechnical Conditions 
•          Natural   Ground:   Moderate   plastic   clay   (CH),   with:
o   California   Bearing   Ratio   (CBR): 5%
o   Maximum   Dry   Density   (Proctor Test):   1620   kg/m³   (15%   water content)
o   Bulk Gravity:   2670   kg/m³
o   Natural Water   Content: 25%
•            Local   Material Availability:
1.          Poorly Graded   Sand   (SP)   (3   km   away):
o   CBR:   27%
o   Optimum   Dry   Density:   1950   kg/m³   (10% water content)
o   Bulk Gravity:   2650   kg/m³
o   Natural Water Content:   8%
o   Suitable for subgrade   but   not as   base or   subbase.
2.          Well-Graded Gravel with some fines   (GW)   (15   km   away):
o   CBR:   85%
o   Optimum   Dry   Density:   2100   kg/m³   (7.5% water content)
o   Bulk Gravity:   2650   kg/m³
o   Natural Water Content:   6%
o   Suitable for subbase   but   not as   a   base   layer.
•            Cross-Section   Details
o   Lane Width: 3.8   m   per   lane.
o   Shoulder Width:   1.5   m each   side.
o   Pavement   Lateral slope:   1:1.2.
o   Embankment   Laterail Slope:   1:1.5   (V:H).
o   The      pavement      layers    are       homogeneous    across    the      full      cross-section,       including    the   shoulders.
Required Tasks 
1. Pavement Design 
Use   the    classical    CBR    methodology   to    design    a    flexible    pavement    solution.    Specify    the    materials   selected for:
•             Subgrade•             Subbase   (if   needed)
•               Base
•             Surface   layersInclude   across-sectional   engineering   plot with   descriptions   of   materials, sizes,   and   units. Justify your   solution and why this better than other options, based on cost effectiveness, construction procedures,   environmental aspects, etc.
2. Embankment Analysis 
Assume:
•             All   layers are compacted to 95%   of their   optimum   dry   density.
•             The   phreatic   level aligns with the current   natural   soil   level.
•             Embankment water content   is   initially   at   its   natural   level.   Determine:
•             Final void   ratio, dry   density,   and   density with   moisture   for the   embankment   material.
•             Effective vertical   normal stress   at the   subgrade   level.
•             Elastic settlement of the   natural   soil   due   to   embankment   and   pavement   weight.
3. Rainfall Impact Analysis 
Assume:
•               Lateral drainage   is   blocked.
•               Longitudinal   road slope   is   null.
•             Rainfall    intensity    equals    the    average    daily    rate    for    Sheffield    over    three    consecutive    days   (source:Met Office).
Evaluate:   whether   the   water   level   will   reach   the   subgrade   and   recalculate   effective   normal   stresses   after the   rainfall.
Updated Costs of the materials 
The following costs   reflect current   UK   market   rates   (as of January   2025):
1. Transport of Embankment Material: £2.0/m³   per   km.
2. Compaction (to 95% Modified Proctor): £65/m³   .
3. Hydraulically Bound Layers: £90/m³   (final density: 2400   kg/m³).
4. Granular Material for Base: £60/m³   (final density:   1950   kg/m³; CBR:   90%).
5. Granular Material for Subbase: £40/m³   (final density:   1750   kg/m³;   CBR: 55%).
6. Asphalt Concrete: £135/m³   (final density: 2500   kg/m³).
For additional costs are   needed,   include sources   and justification.
